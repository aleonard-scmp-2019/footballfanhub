Hi Stephen,

Ok a bit of a steep learning curve on this, but we are going to setup 3 pieces of software on your machine initially...

1) oracle virtual box
this will allow us to run virtual machines on your local dev box there
https://www.virtualbox.org/

2) vagrant
this is a tool that simplifies the creation of VM's and allows us to inject files into the VM etc when and as it spins up and once its up and running
https://www.vagrantup.com/

3) sourcetree
this is a tool that will allow us to talk to your source code repo on gitlab, more of that later...
